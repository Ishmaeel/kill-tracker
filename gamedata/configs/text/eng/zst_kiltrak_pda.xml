		<text>A pocket-sized electronic device meant to encompass the basic and most vital functions of a computer. The PDA is essential for daily information sharing. It comes with pre-installed GPS module to provide geolocation and time information to the user. The module in this version has been greatly improved to retrieve and process the position of other modules connected to the network, which makes this PDA compelling among stalkers. Unlike usual GPS modules, this one relies on sets of codes that allows the module to acquire special privileges on the connected channel to acquire more information.\n \nThis particular device is also able to locate the dead bodies of targets eliminated by the owner because somebody has jailbroken it and installed a pirated version of IMI KilTrak software.\n \n
